// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
(Your pseudocode here)

a = 5
b = 9
a + b = sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
(Your pseudocode here)

 if number is even = true print out "even"
 else print out "odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
A: Create function to recieve an input of a number. 1,2,3,4,5

B: Add the following number to the previsou sum. 0+1=1, then 1+2=3, then 3+3=6, and so on.
Once all values have been added together you can then declare a variable for the average. The average will be the sum total / 3 

C: The function will take in each input and store it until you want your answer. Store numbers 1,2,3,4,5. Once function is ran it will show 1 as minimum and 5 as maximum

D: Just printing out the answer.
print 'average of the five numbers is:"
print "minimum number of the five numbers is:"
print "maximum number of the five numbers is:"
